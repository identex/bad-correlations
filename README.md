#### If you don't have experience with Git and Pull Requests

Submit an issue @ https://github.com/identex/bad-correlations/issues and I will manually add it. By submitting an issue, you can also start conversations about your contribution. You do not need to read any further, we'll handle the rest!

#### If you have experience with Pull Requests

- Step 2.2.1) Fork the repository

- Step 2.2.2) Create a post

Create a new markdown file in the `/_posts/` folder with the naming format `/_posts/YEAR-MONTH-DAY-Title-of-Your-Post.md`

Be sure to include this at the very top of your file:

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: Unemployment Drops after Britney Spears releases "Work Bitch"
date: 2022-03-26
categories: ["culture", "economy"]
---
```

And write your post using Markdown. If you've every written a post or comment on Reddit, you know Markdown! If you need a refresher, [this is a good resource](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

And be sure to include an image! You can add images to the `/images/` folder, and can be referenced with:

```markdown
![your alt text](/bad-correlations/images/yourfile.png)
```

Which will look like:

![your alt text](/bad-correlations/images/workbitch.png)
